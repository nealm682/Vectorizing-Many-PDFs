Here's an example README.md in Markdown format:

```markdown
# Document-Based Chatbot

This is a document-based chatbot that uses a conversational retrieval chain to answer questions based on a provided PDF document. The script breaks down the document into chunks, generates embeddings for each chunk, stores the embeddings in a vector database, and then uses those embeddings to generate responses to user queries.

## Setup

First, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
!pip install -q langchain==0.0.150 pypdf pandas matplotlib tiktoken textract transformers openai faiss-cpu
```

## How to Use

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the script:

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
```

2. Upload your document using the file upload prompt in the script.

3. The script will process your document, split it into chunks, and generate embeddings for each chunk. It will then plot a histogram showing the distribution of chunk lengths.

4. You can then interact with the chatbot by typing questions into the input box. The chatbot will generate responses based on the contents of the uploaded document. 

5. To stop the conversation, just type 'exit'.

Please note that the chatbot works best when the questions are related to the content of the uploaded document.

```

This should give users a clear idea of what the script does and how to use it. Of course, you might need to adjust the details based on your specific requirements or the exact behavior of your script.
